*How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?*

To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, I prefer to get to know the user by talking to them,
observing how they interact with systems, and listening to their desires and frustrations. This gives me a clear idea
of what they need and the obstacles they are facing.

*How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?*

When I approach developing programs, I like to start by getting a clear understanding of the problem I need to solve.
I break down the project into smaller, more manageable pieces and prioritize tasks based on their importance and impact.
This helps me to stay organized as I move forward. As I work on each piece, I try to stay flexible to potential changes.

In terms of Agile processes, there are a couple things I am eager to incorporate into my future development work.
Test-Driven development is something I am keen on, because it promotes writing tests before coding. This can help
catch issues early and ensure that the code is more reliable. After each sprint, I would like to hold retrospectives
to reflect on what performed well, what didn't, and what improvements I can make for the next sprint.

*What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?*

Being a good team member means collaborating openly by participating in discussions, sharing knowledge, and being
willing to help others. Taking responsibility for your tasks and ensuring that they are completed is another essential
trait. If you make a mistake, own up to it, and work with the team to fix it. Delivering on your promises and meeting your
deadlines ensures reliability and builds trust within the team.
